Step #4

Now we need to make it proper tic-tac-toe: once written,
sign should not change.

1. Open script.js
2. Find our `setField` function. We should change it so,
that sign is changed only when this cell is free. 
Let's add a condition:

/** Start of code block */
function setField(i) {
  if (notSet(i)) {
    buttons[i].innerHTML = sign
    
    toggleSign()
  }
}
/** End of code block */

3. We added a function, but has not defined it yet. 
Go to the end of file and add a new function:

/** Start of code block */
function notSet(i) {
  return /** define a condition that will be true if button 
            wasn't clicked and false otherwise
        */
}
/** End of code block */
