/**

Step #3

Till now our button only shows "X"! We need also to show "O".

1. Open script.js.
2. After each click we need to change "X" to "O",
then "O" to "X".
3. Look at our function. Let's add toggleSign() function,
so each time the button is clicked, the current 
sign is flipped. Write: 

/** Start of code block */
function setField(i) {
    <...>
    toggleSign()
}
/** End of code block */

4. And now let's define a function below:

/** Start of code block */
function toggleSign() {
  if (sign /** write here your condition */) {
    /** write code to change sign */
  } else {
    /** write code to change sign back */
  }
}
/** End of code block */

5. Try it!
