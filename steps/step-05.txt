Step #5

Now our game is played only once. Let's make it playable 
many times. Let's add "Reset" button.

1. Open index.html
2. Add a new button inside its "div" after all our buttons:
    
    <!-- Start of html block -->
    <div>
      <button onclick="reset()">
        Reset
      </button>
    </div>
    <!-- End of html block -->
3. As you see, we already defined a function to call
on click: reset(). Let's define it's body.

4. Open now script.js.

5. At the end of the file add new function:

    /** Start of code block */
    function reset() {
        for (/** write how we will iterate from 0 to 9 */) {
            /** write code to reset value of a button to 0..9 */
        }
    }
    /** End of code block */
