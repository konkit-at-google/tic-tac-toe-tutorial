Step #7

But our game is never stopped! We need to forbid clicking
once somebody has won.

1. Open script.js
2. Find a section with "Global variables".
3. Let's add a variable named `gameFinished`,
set it to initial value.
4. Find our function `setField`. We need to add:
    - set `gameFinished = true;` when we know somebody won;
    - add new condition to `if`, so that if game is finished
    we do not execute the logic.
